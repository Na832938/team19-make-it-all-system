## üß≠ Overview  
This repository contains the **UI/UX design assets**, **prototype code**, and **supporting documentation** for Team 19‚Äôs project:  
**Make-It-All Internal Productivity & Knowledge Management System.**

The goal for **Part 1** is to produce a working **static prototype** demonstrating task management and knowledge-sharing features for employees within the company.

## üñåÔ∏è Design & Prototyping  
All design work is created using **Figma**, which allows us to build interactive HTML-style prototypes without writing code.  
Figma is free for students and supports real-time collaboration.

- **Figma Workspace:** (https://www.figma.com/team_invite/redeem/sBtXqhi0ng2vrhRBE3B5VY)
- **Design Owner:** *Nanda Kumudhan*  

Exports (screenshots, mockups) and design documentation are stored in `/design`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies  
| Category | Tools / Frameworks |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Frontend (prototype)** | React.js (mainly `App.jsx`, HTML, CSS) |
| **Styling** | Bootstrap |
| **Charts (if used)** | Chart.js |
| **Version Control** | GitHub |
| **Design** | Figma |
| **Database (later phase)** | MySQL |
| **Backend/server (later phase)** | PHP |

Currently, the **frontend** is developed using **React.js** for component-based task and control logic, alongside standard **HTML** and **CSS** for structure and styling.  
The project will soon be **compiled for PHP server compatibility**, and the **folder structure** will be reorganized accordingly.
